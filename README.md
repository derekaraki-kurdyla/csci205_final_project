## Project Information

may not quite know all the details yet.*

Our final project is an implementation of the popular board game Sorry! through the use of JavaFX and Scene Builder. Up to four players can play on one computer and enjoy the simple yet riveting and competitive game. We wrote 14 java classes and 1 interface, and multiple classes utilize enum values. The game rules are listed in GameRules.txt, but we were not able to successfully write every card to completion as in the original game. However all of the game logic works, including the key component of sending pawns back to start and the multiple slides throughout the board. In order to win the game, a play must get all of their four pawns into the home space. The first player to do so will win.
